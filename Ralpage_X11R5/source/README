This is a virtually complete implementation of PostScript.

Drivers are provided for a selection of machines.

Writing your own driver involves merely hacking pixrect.c
until it will drive your display.
There are only 11 routines to write, and they're all quite short.

Some of the other drivers may provide inspiration, though
the rigmarole you have to go through
to deal with most window systems is likely to be unedifying.

Have fun!
