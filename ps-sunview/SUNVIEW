This introduces the SunView version of the Postscript interpreter. This
is the PD code by Crispin Goswell at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
with modifications by Julian Onions at Nottingham University and very
minor ones by myself. It isn't the fastest interpreter in the world, but
does to date seem to produce fairly correct results.

The tar that follows has been compressed, uuencoded and split.  To
create a copy of the interpreter that will work under SunView running
SunOS3.5, decode everything, go into the "source" directory, edit the
file "config.c" to set the "default_library" string to point to where
you want your postscript libraries to go (/usr/local/lib/ps ??) , "cp
main.c.sunview main.c", "cp makefile.sunview makefile", "make sunview",
"make" and copy the directory "postscript" to the directory you
specified in config.c. The compiled program is called sunPS by default.
 
Under SunOS4.0 you will, I believe, find that the final make fails
twice, I forget in which files exactly. In the first file that make
bombs out on globally substitute "inf" for "infinity" and in the second
globally substitute "l2" for "log2". Then remake. Other than this no  
other modifications should be necessary.
 
A file "ww-info.h" was missing from the original distribution of the
interpreter to comp.sources.unix. Although it does not affect making a
version for Sunview it is necessary when attempting to create new    
drivers.  If anyone gets hold of it I would appreciate a copy.  
 
If anyone hears of a driver that takes advantage of the 8 bit deep
pixrects on colour Suns I would be *VERY* interested...

The program that I used to mail this to you is at the end of this
message.  I'll keep this script lying around in case you need anything
else.  Any problems, get in touch.
