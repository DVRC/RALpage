In order to run xps, you need to set the environment variable:

setenv POSTSCRIPTLIB /priam/mit/opus/postscript/postscript

Then you can run xps.

xps filename.ps

will run the file, and will wait for you to hit return everywhere
there is a 'showpage' command.  If the file does not have a
'showpage' (usually only with hand-written programs), then the window
will go away immediately after drawing the picture.  If you find this
happens, you can type 'xps -i filename.ps'.  This will cause xps to
give you a PS> prompt after running your program.  Type 'quit' to exit
the program.
